# task5 :SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full) 
Frist we want to create 3 tables (emp,dept,salgrade)
--Inner Join
Retrieve matched rows only (EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO)
Use of aliases (E, D)
Inclusion of SALGRADE using BETWEEN
SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL, E.DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC, GRADE FROM EMP E, DEPT D, SALGRADE S
WHERE E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO AND SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL;
You're using Oracle-style joins (comma(,) + WHERE). 
This can be modernized using ANSI joins (INNER JOIN, ON)
-----Left Outer Join
SELECT ... FROM EMP E LEFT OUTER JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO=D.DEPTNO;
SELECT ... FROM EMP, DEPT WHERE EMP.DEPTNO = DEPT.DEPTNO(+);
------Right Outer Join 
Single and multiple joins
SELECT E.EMPNO, E.ENAME, E.SAL, D.DNAME, S.GRADE FROM EMP E RIGHT JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO RIGHT JOIN SALGRADE S ON E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL;
------Full Outer Join 
SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL, E.DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC, GRADE FROM EMP E FULL OUTER JOIN DEPT D ON E.DEPTNO = D.DEPTNO FULL OUTER JOIN SALGRADE S ON E.SAL BETWEEN S.LOSAL AND S.HISAL;
SELECT EMPNO, ENAME, JOB, SAL, E.DEPTNO, DNAME, LOC, GRADE
FROM EMP E

-- SQL Join Examples with EMP, DEPT, SALGRADE
 Filters using "BETWEEN", "LIKE", "IS NULL", and department-based conditions
